Résumé
======

This is my resume written in Java using Processing. 
There's not really much more then that. 
Though, this does make a great way to nicely display your resume on your website!


P.S. Yes, it's very poorly optimized, and outdated. I'll update this with an updated version of my resume, and work on some optimazation. Right now, as you can see, all it is is a for loop looping over an array, simple, effective, but not the best way to make it work.
